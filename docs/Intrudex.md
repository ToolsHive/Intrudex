**Intrudex** is a *comprehensive*, **lightweight** intrusion detection and prevention system (**IDPS**) specifically designed for **Windows environments**. Leveraging the power of [*Sigma rules*](https://sigmahq.io/)—a community-driven standard for describing log events—Intrudex continuously monitors **Windows Event Logs** to identify *suspicious activity*, *potential threats*, and *indicators of compromise*.

## **_Key Features_**

-  **Real-Time Threat Detection:** Monitors Windows Event Logs and applies [*Sigma rules*](https://sigmahq.io/) to detect suspicious activity as it happens.
-  **Modular Architecture:** Flexible design suitable for both individuals and organizations, allowing easy customization and extension.
-  **Web Dashboard:** Centralized monitoring and management via a user-friendly [*Flask-based dashboard*](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/).
-  **Self-Healing Mechanisms:** Ensures persistent protection, even against attempts to disable or tamper with the system.

## **_How It Works_**

1.  **Log Collection:** Continuously gathers *Windows Event Logs* from the endpoint.
2.  **Sigma Rule Application:** Transforms raw log data into *meaningful alerts* using community-driven [Sigma rules](https://sigmahq.io/).
3.  **Threat Analysis:** Evaluates alerts to determine the severity and nature of detected threats.
4.  **Centralized Monitoring:** Presents all alerts and findings in a web dashboard for easy review and management.
