## üéØ Introduction
Intrudex is a **state-of-the-art, Sigma-based Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IPS/IDS)**, specifically designed for **Windows environments**. It features a **hybrid architecture**, combining the efficiency of a **C++ Windows client** for real-time log monitoring with a **Python Flask-based server** for centralized management and a **web dashboard**.

Intrudex leverages **Sigma rules** to detect threats in **Windows Event Logs**, providing **real-time security alerts** and **automatic threat response mechanisms**.

---

## ‚≠ê Features
- **Windows Log Monitoring** ‚Äì Uses **Sysmon** and **Windows Event Logs** for security monitoring.  
- **Sigma Rule-Based Detection** ‚Äì Converts Sigma rules into **real-time security alerts**.  
- **Standalone & Server Mode** ‚Äì Can function **independently** or connect to a **Flask-based server**.  
- **Windows Notifications** ‚Äì Displays **security alerts** natively on Windows.  
- **Automatic Threat Response (IPS)** ‚Äì Blocks IPs, kills processes, and disables accounts upon threat detection.  
- **Remote Command Execution** ‚Äì Allows **remote security commands** from the web dashboard.  
- **Self-Healing System** ‚Äì Uses **registry entries and scheduled tasks** to prevent tampering.  
- **Web Dashboard (Flask)** ‚Äì Provides **log visualization, rule management, and remote control**.  
- **Public/Private Key Authentication** ‚Äì Ensures **secure client-server communication**.  
- **Log Backup & Report Generator** ‚Äì Stores logs in a **database** with export functionality.
